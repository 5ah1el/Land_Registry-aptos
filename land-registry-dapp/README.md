# Land Registry DApp on Aptos Blockchain

## Overview

Traditional land registration systems are centralized, slow, and prone to corruption, leading to issues like fraud, lack of transparency, high costs, delays, data tampering, and limited accessibility. 

*Solution:*  
Build a *decentralized land registry* on the *Aptos blockchain* where each land parcel is represented as a unique NFT, ensuring secure, transparent, and tamper-proof ownership records.

---

## Features

- *Register new land parcels* as NFTs
- *Verify ownership* securely and transparently
- *Transfer land ownership* between parties
- *Record disputes & mortgages* immutably
- *Decentralized & tamper-proof* data storage
- *Accessible* for rural and foreign buyers

---

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend:* Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- *Blockchain:* Aptos Blockchain
- *Smart Contracts:* Move language
- *Wallet Integration:* Aptos Wallet (browser extension)
- *Development Tools:* aptos CLI, Aptos Devnet

---

## Project Setup & Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Aptos CLI installed
- Aptos Devnet account and wallet
- Basic knowledge of blockchain and Next.js

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/land-registry-aptos.git
cd land-registry-aptos


### 2. Install Dependencies

bash
npm install
# or
yarn install


### 3. Setup Aptos Wallet & Devnet

- Install [Aptos Wallet Browser Extension](https://aptos.dev/tools/wallet/overview)
- Create or import an account
- Connect to Aptos Devnet

### 4. Deploy Smart Contracts (Move Modules)

- Write Move smart contracts for:

  - Land registration
  - Ownership transfer
  - Dispute recording

- Compile and deploy smart contracts to Aptos Devnet:

bash
aptos move compile
aptos move publish --profile devnet


(Follow detailed Aptos Move development guide for creating and deploying modules)

### 5. Configure Frontend to Interact with Aptos

- Update environment variables with your deployed module address and network info:

Create .env.local:

env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_NODE_URL=https://fullnode.devnet.aptos.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedModuleAddress


### 6. Run the Development Server

bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev


Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## How It Works

- *Register Property:* User inputs land details; frontend interacts with Move smart contract to mint a new NFT representing the land.
- *Verify Ownership:* Query the blockchain for the land NFT ownership.
- *Transfer Ownership:* Transfer the land NFT to another user via smart contract call.
- *Record Disputes/Mortgages:* Store relevant data immutably on the blockchain.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add dispute resolution mechanisms
- Integrate with government land registry APIs
- Implement multi-party verification
- Enhance UI/UX
